      <h1>The Cantina Azul Story</h1>
      <img src="placeholder.jpg" alt="Rosa Fernandez, the founder of Cantina Azul." >
      <p>Cantina Azul opened its doors in 1979 by Rosa Fernandez. She immigrated to the United States in 1965 with her family and eventually persued her dream of brining her favorite family recipes to her new home in California and entering the restaurant business. The restaurant is named about her dog, Azul. Today the Cantina Azul is run by her son, Jose.</p>
      <p>Cantina Azul features dishes from various regions of Mexico. We work closely with local farmers and fishmongers to bring you the freshest ingredients, including: free-range, organic poultry, hormone free meats, and organic produce, when possible. Our full bar offers handcrafted cocktails, an extensive tequila and mezcal collection, and local beer and wine.</p>
      <p>Our interior features handmade bar tiles, colorful textiles, rustic concrete countertops, Mexican lanterns, and wood art installations that will transport you to the Mexican vacation of your dreams.</p>
