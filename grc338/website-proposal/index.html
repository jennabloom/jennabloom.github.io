            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <p>Jenna’s Blooms </p>
            
            <p>Jenna's Blooms is a small, locally owned flower shop with one location in downtown SLO. The company uses the physical store and a website, which customers can also order flowers off of.</p>
            
            <h2>Target audience</h2>
            
            <p>The target audience is not limited to one generation or age group, as flowers are for everyone. However, our company has a trendy, fresh vibe so will be aiming mainly for millennials - particularly women. They have a well-paying salary and aren’t afraid to splurge, as our products are high end. </p>
           
            <p>Our target audience’s primary goals are either buying flowers on a special occasion for significant others, friends and family members, or getting flowers for an event. A large portion of our clients are people getting married who seek flowers for a wedding.</p>
